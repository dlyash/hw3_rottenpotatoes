# Add a declarative step here for populating the DB with movies.

Given /the following movies exist/ do |movies_table|
  movies_table.hashes.each do |movie|
    # each returned element will be a hash whose key is the table header.
    # you should arrange to add that movie to the database here.
    
    Movie.create!(movie)
  end
end

# Make sure that one string (regexp) occurs before or after another one
#   on the same page

Then /I should see "(.*)" before "(.*)"/ do |e1, e2|
  assert_match(/#{e1}.*#{e2}/m, page.body)
end

# Make it easier to express checking or unchecking several boxes at once
#  "When I uncheck the following ratings: PG, G, R"
#  "When I check the following ratings: G"

When /I (un)?check the following ratings: (.*)/ do |uncheck, rating_list|
  # HINT: use String#split to split up the rating_list, then
  #   iterate over the ratings and reuse the "When I check..." or
  #   "When I uncheck..." steps in lines 89-95 of web_steps.rb
  
  method = uncheck.nil? ? :check : :uncheck
  
  rating_list.split(/\s*,\s*/).each { |rating|
